## Hello traveler

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on a new puzzle game as a sequel to Fliprule.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment I'm learning Flutter to build a crossplatform app I have in mind.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking for feedback and contributions to my [cuda-noise](https://github.com/covexp/cuda-noise) project for using noise functions inside CUDA kernels.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about game development, computer graphics, GPU computation or procedural generation.
